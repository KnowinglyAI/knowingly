In contrast, forum engines, such as vBulletin are often free from AJAX, meaning that when a thread's HTML is loaded, every comment in it are *hardcoded*, meaning that even if the *fancy parts* (CSS, images and so on) are not loaded, I can already read the comments.My needs are very special though, so I'm interested - is there any general UX advantage of any of these?",

Usually a business request was firstly analysed by the Business Analysts, but now we want to improve the experience of our users and also make research in this scope (here we want to intergrate the UX Designer role). We want to bring the design process before starting the developing one and this UX activity to be also marked in our backlog. For example this sprint we created a UX Research user story with the purpose to improve the way that users search for a document inside of one our apps (the tasks that were included in this user story: to create a research plan, run interviews, run usability tests, synthetize data). The estimation of this user story was made by our *inside feeling*, but now we want to define some criteria (for example when we estimate a development user story our criteria are the time, rank of unknown, risks, knowledge level). Also we can't mark this activity in a *sprint zero* because the journey between research and a tested prorototype can take months in some complex situations.",

Once the developers start to build, they will follow a agile process, building aspects of the project in stages/sprints. The results of these sprints are then further tested and feedback is given to the developers to implement, which is how the UI/UX designer is then part of the Agile process.Is this correct?

Engine should trace “player” behaviour, evaluate its capabilities and quickly meet its needs. 2. Immersion generated by simulation enables training and experimentation of behaviour strategies, in particular learning “by doing”. 3. Engine should use following resources : 3.1. Tools to be customized by trainers. 3.2. Applied standards. 3.3. New learning approaches discovery through obtained results, whether these approaches are positive or negative, in the sense of improving technology performance of assembled prototypes. 4. How SPDF (Standard Process Description Format) may produce a universal engine to run the stochastic model ? 4.1. SPDF consists of two parts : 4.1.1. Message structured-data part (including semantics) and, 4.1.2. Process description part (with higher level of semantics). 4.2. Two key outputs of the SPDF research will be a process description specification and framework for the extraction of semantics from legacy systems. 4.2.3. Note that : a)The more we may have semantic rules the more unpredictable events are controlled. b) Acquired knowledge to elaborate semantic rules for unpredictable events requires many occurrences of the stochastic model. c) Convergence shall not be reached until getting more qualitative semantic rules. d) Performing dynamically a given scenario is the goal of the proposed messaging system.",
